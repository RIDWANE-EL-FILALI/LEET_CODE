    substring
    without repeating characters.

### example
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

    Input: s = "pwwkew"

    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

### Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
